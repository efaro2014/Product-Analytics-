        It is estimated by the WHO that there are 466 million people in the world with disabling hearing loss (6.1 %). Given the prevalence of this disability, American Sign Language (ASL) was developed naturally over time so that these individuals are able to communicate with others. One limitation of ASL is that not all people are familiar with this language, and must rely on a translator to communicate with ASL users. Additionally, learning ASL can be challenging, as it has its own rules for “pronunciation, word formation, and word order”. To alleviate this issue, our product is envisioned to be a web application that is capable of translating ASL into spoken languages and vice-versa. We hope to take text as an input, and generate the translation into ASL in the form of visual output and vice versa. The aim of our project is to help deaf or other hard-of-hearing people communicate with others. Specifically, our product could potentially aid teachers at school communicating with children that are hard-of-hearing or deaf.
